      <h5>Facebook</h5>
      <p>
        During the summer of 2019, I was granted the opportunity to learn
        Android Application development in Menlo park, California. I was able to
        further understand the language of java, and the practices needed to
        build both simple and complex dynamic applications. I concluded my
        intership after wroking in a team of 3 members to ideate & develop our
        own social media based application based around positive contribution
        and service to ones community.

      <h5>Harvard Computer Science Tutor</h5>
      <p>
        During the second semester of the 2018-2019 school year, I was granted
        the opportunity to tutor my fellow peers in the course "Great Ideas In

        language of java, and the essential data thypes and the ways one can
        manipulate these data types in complex methods.

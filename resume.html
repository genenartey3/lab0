      <p>
        During the summer of 2019, I was granted the opportunity to learn
        Android Application development in Menlo park, California. I was able to
        further understand the language of java, and the practices needed to
        build both simple and complex dynamic applications. I concluded my
        intership after wroking in a team of 3 members to ideate & develop our
        own social media based application based around positive contribution
        and service to ones community.
